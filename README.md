SELL - Source Editor at Language Level
--------------------------------------

This implementation is experimental, 
and the basic functionalities are still under development. 
The code was written with my feet. 

SELL is an **AST oriented structural source code editor**. 
Currently it supports editing JSON only. 

Features:

* Never makes a syntax error. 
* Vi-like keyboard controlling. 
* Tree based efficient cursor moving.
* Tree level operations as first class citizens. 
* Stack based temporary location bookmarking.

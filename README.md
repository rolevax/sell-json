SELL - Source Editor at Language Level
--------------------------------------

This implementation is experimental, 
and the code was written with my feet. 

SELL is an **AST oriented structural source code editor**. 

Features:

* Never makes a syntax error. 
* Vi-like keyboard controlling. 
* Tree based efficient cursor moving.
* Tree level operations as first class citizens. 
* Stack based temporary location bookmarking. 

Currently SELL supports JSON only. 
In the future it will adapt to arbitrary tree-like language. 

Using Qt and RapidJSON.
